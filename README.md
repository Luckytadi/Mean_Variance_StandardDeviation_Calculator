# Mean_Variance_StandardDeviation_Calculator
<h1> User Input Handling: </h1> The function uses input() to get a string of numbers from the user, which are split into a list and converted to floats., <br>
<h1> Validation: </h1> It checks if the input list has exactly nine elements using len(input_list). If not, a ValueError is raised. <br>
<h1> NumPy Operations: </h1> <br>
np.array() converts the list into a NumPy array. <br>
reshape(3, 3) converts the 1-dimensional array into a 3x3 matrix. <br>
np.mean(), np.var(), np.std(), np.max(), np.min(), and np.sum() compute the statistical metrics required. <br>
<b> Output: </b> The function prints the matrix and computed statistics. <br>
This function handles typical user input errors (e.g., incorrect number of values) and utilizes NumPy efficiently to perform the required calculations. Adjust the error message or handling as per your specific needs or application context. <br>
